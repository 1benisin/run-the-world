# Map Functionality PRD

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds Google Maps integration to the Run The World app, enabling users to view territories captured through runs and track their current runs. The map will be implemented in both the Location screen and a future Running screen, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience.

## Goals

1. Display territories as colored polygons on the map - dummy data for now
2. Enable real-time run tracking with path visualization
3. Provide accurate user location tracking
4. Ensure smooth map performance with proper error handling
5. Create an intuitive and responsive map interface

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to see territories captured by runs on the map so I can understand the game's progress
2. As a user, I want to see my current location on the map so I can navigate effectively
3. As a user, I want to track my run in real-time so I can see my progress
4. As a user, I want to easily return to my current location on the map
5. As a user, I want clear instructions when location services are disabled

## Functional Requirements

1. Map Display

   - The system must display a full-screen Google Map
   - The map must show territories as colored polygons
   - The map must maintain a fixed north orientation
   - The map must support zoom in/out functionality
   - The map must include a "My Location" button

2. Location Services

   - The system must request location permissions on first use
   - The system must handle location permission denial with:
     - A friendly error message
     - A button to open device settings
     - A default location (city center) as fallback
   - The system must show the user's current location when available

3. Run Tracking - this will be handled by a separate feature. do not make tasks for this.

   - The system must display the current run's path in real-time
   - The system must update the path continuously during the run
   - The system must show the user's current position during a run

4. Territory Display - dummy data for now
   - The system must display territories as colored polygons
   - The system must use different colors for different territories
   - The system must update territory display when new runs are completed

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Territory capture during runs (will be handled by a separate feature)
2. Run statistics and metrics (will be handled by a separate feature)
3. Map rotation based on device orientation - device orentation is always vertcal
4. Offline map functionality
5. Custom map styling beyond basic territory colors

## Design Considerations

1. Map Interface

   - Full-screen implementation
   - Fixed north orientation
   - Zoom controls - just pinch and zoom
   - "My Location" button in a consistent position
   - Clear visual hierarchy for territories

2. Error States
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Clear call-to-action buttons
   - Fallback to default location

## Technical Considerations

1. Dependencies

   - expo-location for location services
   - react-native-maps for map implementation
   - Custom hook for location management

2. Performance
   - Efficient polygon rendering
   - Smooth real-time updates
   - Proper memory management for long-running sessions

## Success Metrics

1. Map load time under 2 seconds
2. Smooth frame rate (60fps) during map interaction
3. Accurate location tracking
4. Proper error handling and user guidance
5. Successful territory visualization

## Open Questions - just use your best judgement

1. What should be the default zoom level for the map?
2. Should there be any limits on the number of territories displayed at once?
3. What should be the default city center location?
4. Should there be any specific color schemes for territories?
5. How should the app handle poor GPS signal during runs?
