# 🏃 Run the World - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** Run the World

**Summary:**
Run the World is a real-world running game where users claim and conquer physical territory using GPS-tracked runs. Each run "inks" a path on the map, creating a digital kingdom. Users compete for dominance by carving out new ground or stealing it from others, blending the thrill of fitness with the strategy of territory control.
